					<h2>Python</h2>
					<p>In highschool I took an <i>Intro to Computer Programming</i> class where I learned Python and then earned an Academic Award of Excellence for the class. After I countinued to tinker and play with python mostly using the Turtle graphics lybrary. </p><br><br>
					<p>Most of my Python work has been on REPL.it so that I can access and work on it anytime.</p>

					<h3>Random Path Generator</h3><br>
					<p>This is what I've made that I am the most proud of. This uses Python with turtle to make a random path generator. The turtle navigates around the canvas on a grid system using coordinates. It has the ability to see where it has been and even back track if it gets stuck. I started working on this during my Sophmore year of highschool and made the 5th and final version a year later during my Junior year.</p><br><br>

					<h3>Word Scrambler</h3><br>
					<p>This was a simple script that I made for a classmate. I first I thought it would be a few simple lines but it turned out to be a lot more then I initialy thought I would need.</p><br><br>

					<h3>Factor Calculator</h3><br>
					<p>So I may or may not of created this to cheat in math class, but after I finished making this I could remember the entire Quadratic Equation off the top of my head. Anyways, I feel this is a really good example of my ability to translate mathimatical equations into Python.</p><br><br>
